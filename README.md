# Bayesian inference for pooled haplotype data using latent multinomials

Two case: shared multinomial probabilities, or hierarchical structure.

Needs `PyMC`, `4ti2`, and `pulp` as dependencies. Note that `pulp` is used as interface for mixed integer programming.

Performance in the first case will be compared with `hippo_aeml`.
